Mark you filament 120mm above the entry to your extruder.
Heat up the nozzle to your desired printing temperature
Home all axis to get in "printer ready" state
Lift up your nozzle by 50mm (to make room for the filament!)
  - "G1 Z50 F1200" -> moves z 50mm

Execute the following commands (one by one)
  - "G92 E0" => This resets the "extruded material" value to 0.
  - "G1 E100 F100" => This extrudes 100mm filament with 100mm/min.

Now measure the distance between your extruder entry and the mark on your filament.

I.e if it is 28mm instead of 20mm (120mm - 100mm) than you are UNDERextruding by 8mm ==> 92mm instead of 100mm. If it shows 15mm than your are OVERextruding by 5mm ==> 105mm.

Now calc:

c := current value in configuration.cfg
m := measured left over filament
d := desired mm
n := new value for configuration.cfg

((120 - m) / d) * c = n
